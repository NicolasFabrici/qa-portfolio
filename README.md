---

## Overview

This portfolio demonstrates practical Quality Assurance experience across multiple domains, including e-commerce and banking systems.  

The projects simulate real-world enterprise environments with:

- Functional testing
- API validation
- Automation coverage
- Performance testing
- Database validation
- CI/CD integration
- Risk-based testing approach

The goal of this repository is to showcase technical QA capabilities beyond manual testing.
